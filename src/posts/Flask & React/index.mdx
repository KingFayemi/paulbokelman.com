# Overview

## This tutorial will show how to utilize the Flask framework for backend and ReactJS for front end. This example will show how to use Flask and SQLAlchemy to create a simple database that the front end React can access and modify.

## In this specific project we will be creating 3 input fields that will **"POST"** information in a database created in SQLAlchemy. The project will also **"GET"** information from the database and display all previous records of information as well as the new record.

# Prerequisites

## In order to properly proceed with this tutorial make sure that you have fulfilled all prerequisites:

- Latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
- Latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed
- [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) installed (already installed with latest python)

# Setting Up

## The first thing we need to do is establish a location (directory) for all of our files. In order to do this we will utilize the `create-react-app` library. First open your systems terminal or command prompt and change directories (cd) to your desired project location. In my case I want it to be on my desktop.

```bash
cd Desktop
```

## Now that we are in the desired location for our project we have to create our project folder. The easiest and fastest way to get started with a new react project is to use `create-react-app` so that is what we will do. In the command prompt, in the right path, run `npx create-react-app NAME`. In my case I want to name my project "python-react" but you can name yours anything.

```bash
npx create-react-app python-react
```

## This will create a new react app by the name you chose. The next step is to make and configure a folder for our python. To do this change directories (cd) into your new react project folder and then make a new directory inside using `mkdir` followed by "python". This will create a new folder inside of our project called "python". Then we want to change directories (cd) into our python folder.

```bash
cd python-react
mkdir python
cd python
```

## The next thing to do is to create our virtual environment for our python project. To do this run `py -m venv env` on windows or `python -m virtualenv env` on linux/mac. This command will create a virtual environment for us to store project specific packages such as Flask and SQLAlchemy.

```cmd
py -m venv env
```

```bash
python -m virtualenv env
```

## At this point in time our filesystem should look like this.

```
python-react/
├─ node_modules/...
├─ public/...
├─ python/
│  ├─ env/
│  │  ├─ Include/...
│  │  ├─ Scripts/...
│  │  ├─ Lib/...
├─ src/...
```

# Python

## Now we have to activate our virtual environment and add the packages we need to proceed with the project. The process for activating the virtual environment is different across operating systems.

- **Windows:** `cd Scripts/env` then `activate.bat`.

- **Mac/Linux:** `source env/bin/activate`.

> If you have any issues with this step please refer to the virtual environment documentation by [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/).

## After the virtual environment is activated we have to install our project dependencies or packages. To do this first exit the Scripts or bin directory back to the main python directory by using `cd..` or `cd -` on mac/linux (goes back 1 directory). When you are in your main python folder we need to install Flask and SQLAlchemy, to do this run `pip install flask` for flask and `pip install flask-sqlalchemy` for SQLAlchemy. This will install our packages in our virtual environment.
