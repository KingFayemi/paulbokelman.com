# Overview

Throughout my journey of fullstack development i've encountered my fair share of technologies that help aid me when developing web applications so I thought i'd share some of my top picks.

The three basic aspects of full stack development consist of 3 main sections, frontend, backend, and deployment. That being said in the interest of keeping things quick and interesting all of the sections will be available in the table of contents to be easily navigated to.

# Frontend

<CS>
  <h2>
    <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>
  </h2>
  <Display iconOf="react" />
  <p>
    For me React is my go to javascript library for developing web applications
    because of its advance component based structure as well as its provided
    hooks that allow you easily to implement a multitude of things into your
    components such as state. The development process for web applications as
    never been easier.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Components
    <p>
      Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single
      app usually consists of multiple components. A component is essentially a
      piece of the user interface. React splits the UI into independent,
      reusable parts that can be processed separately. Learn more about{" "}
      <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html">
        components
      </a>
      .
    </p>
    JSX
    <p>
      By using JSX we can simply write the "HTML" we all know and love straight
      into our javascript files, this allows for really quick development and
      relives all of the nightmares of having separated HTML from our
      Javascript. Learn more about{" "}
      <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>.
    </p>
    Virtual DOM
    <p>
      As defined by{" "}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_DOM">Wikipedia</a>, "A
      virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the DOM used in
      declarative web frameworks such as React, Vue.js, and Elm.[1] Updating the
      virtual DOM is comparatively faster than updating the actual DOM, since
      nothing has to be rendered onto the screen." Basically this means that the
      development process is super painless because we can develop with really
      fast realtime updates and such.
    </p>
    Libraries
    <p>
      One of Reacts game changers is its massive ecosystem of libraries to aid
      you in your development process. Libraries can help with every aspect of
      your project so you don't need to re-invent the wheel every time you add
      new features. Some notable React libraries are,{" "}
      <a href="https://reactrouter.com/">React router</a>,{" "}
      <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>, and of course{" "}
      <a href="https://styled-components.com/">Styled-components</a> &{" "}
      <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand">Zustand</a> (my two personal
      favorites).

  <h2>
    <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a>
  </h2>
  <Display iconOf="vite" />
  <p>
    Vite is a easy choice for me in most cases versus{" "}
    <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">
      create-react-app
    </a>
    , <a href="https://nextjs.org/">next.js</a>, and <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">
      gatsby
    </a> (smaller applications) because its just incredibly quick, I mean really
    just look at this <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1355379680275128321">
      clip
    </a> of a side by side comparison of create-react-app and Vite. Because Vite
    is so quick it makes the developer experience and effort that much better.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Esbuild
    <p>
      Under the hood Vite uses esbuild to pre-bundle packages and modules in
      order to deliver that blazing fast speeds that it preforms at. The reason
      this is so much faster than typical frameworks is because esbuild is built
      in golang and not javascript which makes it just that much faster, I mean
      look at these <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">bench marks</a>. Learn
      more about <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a>.
    </p>
    Native TS & JSX
    <p>
      Both Typescript and JSX are supported right out of the box with Vite, if
      that wasn't enough get this, Vite also uses esbuild to transpile the
      typescript and or jsx which means that it is about 20~30x faster than
      vanilla transpilation. Learn more about Native{" "}
      <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#typescript">TS</a> &{" "}
      <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#jsx">JSX</a>.
    </p>
    Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
    <p>
      As per the{" "}
      <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement">
        docs
      </a>
      , "Frameworks with HMR capabilities can leverage the API to provide instant,
      precise updates without reloading the page or blowing away application state."
      Basically this means that the hot reload time after making changes whilst developing
      is incredibly fast which makes working on the application much easier and more
      efficient. Learn more about <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement">

  <h2>
    <a href="https://styled-components.com/">Styled-components</a>
  </h2>
  <Display iconOf="styledcomponents" />
  <p>
    By far my favorite library to use along side React is styled-components.
    This library is very simple, basically styled-components allows you to write
    javascript inside of css as well as create "styled" components (duh) which
    are react components that have specific styles assigned to them.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Props
    <p>
      Probably one of the nicest and most useful features of styled-components
      is that you can pass them props to then use to do whatever you want with,
      for example, if we passed a prop of red and set it to false then in the
      styled component we could check the value of that prop and render the
      color accordingly. If this example didn't make sense or you want to learn
      more,{" "}
      <a href="https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#passed-props">
        passing props in styled components
      </a>
      .
    </p>
    Inheritance
    <p>
      A key feature of styled-components is its simple inheritance approach.
      With component inheritance inside of the styles it makes it really easy to
      create a base component like a button then just apply colors or other
      attributes in a separate component to those base styles without rewriting
      them. This approach to styling really streamlines the development process.
      Learn more about{" "}
      <a href="https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#extending-styles">
        inheritance
      </a>
      .
    </p>
    Themes
    <p>
      Themes is a very useful feature that we can utilize with
      styled-components. Themes allow us to create separate files with all our
      colors, fonts, sizes, etc... and pass them to the theme-provider then like
      magic, we can use those colors through props in all of our styled
      components! Theming is especially useful when working on a large scale
      project where you want to keep all of your style attributes consistent and
      or organized to later use. Learn more about{" "}
      <a href="https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming">themes</a>.

<!-- ## Faker.js

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). -->
