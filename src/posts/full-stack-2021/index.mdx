# Overview

Throughout my journey of fullstack development i've encountered my fair share of technologies that help aid me when developing web applications so I thought i'd share some of my top picks.

The three basic aspects of full stack development consist of 3 main sections, frontend, backend, and deployment. That being said in the interest of keeping things quick and interesting all of the sections will be available in the table of contents to be easily navigated to.

# Frontend

  <h2>

  <p>
    For me React is my go to javascript library for developing web applications
    because of its advance component based structure as well as its provided
    hooks that allow you easily to implement a multitude of things into your
    components such as state. The development process for web applications as
    never been easier.

  Components
    <p>Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. A component is essentially a piece of the user interface. React splits the UI into independent, reusable parts that can be processed separately.</p>

## Vite

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
