# Background

## Recently I was involved in a hackathon and eventually our team settled on a very ambitious project, a fully functional nft collectible site. Going into the project all of us had little to no knowledge regarding nfts, the ethereum blockchain, and all of the other buzz words regarding the project. Long story short I was tasked with the job of everything related to this mystical topic and although I got pretty far by the end of the 48 hours there was still so much that never worked or I didn't understand throughout the process. So after the hackathon I was determined to finish what I started and understand what I didn't previously understand.

## That being said I want to help you get jump started in understanding the ethereum blockchain and what building a decentralized app around it entails, and also understanding all of those random buzzwords I just mentioned.

# Overview

## We will be building a React application that interacts with a custom smart contract made in Solidity by using Web3. Throughout the project you will learn the basics of writing smart contracts in Solidity, how to interact with them on the frontend with Web3, and most importantly add your own creative touch to the final product.

## Specifically we will be creating an application where the admin (you) can mint nfts to your store for others to purchases with ethereum. The application will include:

- **Home** page to display total supply & allow for transactions.
- **Admin** page in order to mint new nfts to supply.
- **Profile** page so that the user can view their currently owned nfts.

# Prerequisites

## Basic knowledge of React

- Throughout this journey we will be taking things pretty slow although with that being said some sections may be hard to follow along without a decent understanding of React.

## Metamask

- You will need to download and make a metamask account in order to simulate purchases on the ethereum blockchain as well as to verify that we have everything working.

# Contents

## I don't know about you but I really appreciate it when a blog explains right at the beginning what is going to be used to achieve the desired outcome and a brief understanding of those things, that way if I came to the blog to learn everything, it helps me quickly understand some basic terms that will be mentioned or if I just need 1 thing from the blog that will clarify something in my code I can quickly find it and move on.

## So here is what we will be using.

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - Javascript framework for quickly building web applications.
- [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)
  - [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) - A world class development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aiming to make life as a developer easier.
  - [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) - A personal blockchain for Ethereum development you can use to deploy contracts, develop your applications, and run tests.
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) - A crypto wallet & gateway to blockchain apps
- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.3/) - high-level language for implementing [smart contracts](https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts).
- [Open Zeppelin Contracts](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/) - Premade smart contracts with implementations of [ERC](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc) standards.
- [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) - very easy way to upload and manage files on [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/)

## If you are completely unfamiliar with most of these technologies that is completely fine, because I was too at one point I promise you that they sound a lot more scary than they actually are so lets get into it!

# Setting Up

## Setting up a dapp from scratch is a pain to say the least but thankfully we have Truffle. If you are familiar with reacts [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) then truffle will make a lot of sense. In order to get started with truffle we need to first install the truffle cli, we can do so by running `npm install truffle -g` in our terminal.

```bash
npm install truffle -g
```

## We can now utilize [Truffle Boxes](https://www.trufflesuite.com/boxes) in order to quickly setup a react app to start using smart contracts. To do this first make a new directory and then after entering the directory run `npx truffle unbox react`, the process should look like this.

```bash
mkdir custom-nfts
cd custom-nfts
npx truffle unbox react
```

## After running this you should see that our new folder has been filled with a couple folders and some files, this is our barebones dapp.

## Now we open our new project by either running `code .` in the directory or just opening it in your favorite code editor (I will be using [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

## After opening the project in our editor we are going to change directories to the client folder and then run `npm install` to install our required node_modules folder.

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

## Before firing up our project we need to first do a couple of things. The first thing we need to do is install [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) and after opening it we should be presented with this.

<img
  src={props.images[0].publicURL}
  style={{
    width: "100%",
    height: "100%",
  }}
/>

## Click on the "QUICKSTART" button and you should be prompted with a screen that shows a lot of account addresses, these will be our testing accounts for when we want to try out our product.

## At this point Ganache is all set up we don't need to worry about it anymore just leave it running in the background. The next thing we need to do is make some changes to our `truffle-config.js`. Normally truffle expects you to use `truffle develop` in order to run the simulated blockchain but because we are using ganache we have to make some changes to the networks. Copy the snippet below and delete everything currently in the file and replace it with this.

```js -r-[truffle-config.js]/copy/
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  contracts_build_directory: path.join(__dirname, "client/src/contracts"),
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*",
    },
  },
};
```

## At this point our project is now properly connected to the ganache server we have running in the background. The final process in setting up our project is to convert our existing `App.js` from a class component into a react component that utilizes reacts hooks. This step is not required but I am most familiar with using react with its components so it is what I will do.

## In order to keep things organized I will first create a components folder in the src directory and then create a new file inside of the newly created components folder and name it `InitWeb3.js`. This new file will be where we will store and export our two main functions `loadWeb3` and `loadBlockchainData`, these two functions will be revised code of the already existing initialization process in the `App.js` but separated from our main `App` component in order to reduce clutter. We can also delete the following files, `App.test.js`, `getWeb3.js`, and `logo.svg`. Although I am not going to go over what each line does I will leave some comments to help you understand.

```js -r-[InitWeb3.js]/copy/
import Web3 from "web3";
import SimpleStorageContract from "../contracts/SimpleStorage.json";

export async function loadWeb3() {
  if (window.ethereum) {
    // Checking if browser is Ethereum with metamask
    window.web3 = new Web3(window.ethereum);
    await window.ethereum.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" });
  } else if (window.web3) {
    window.web3 = new Web3(window.ethereum);
  } else {
    window.alert(
      "Non-Ethereum browser detected. You should consider trying MetaMask"
    );
  }
}
export async function loadBlockchainData() {
  const web3 = window.web3; // creating web3 instance
  const ethereum = window.ethereum; // ethereum instance
  const accounts = await ethereum.request({ method: "eth_accounts" }); // loading all accounts
  const networkId = await web3.eth.net.getId(); // getting current network id
  const networkData = SimpleStorageContract.networks[networkId]; // getting smart contract data
  if (networkData) {
    // IF WE HAVE NETWORK DATA
    const abi = SimpleStorageContract.abi;
    const address = networkData.address;
    const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, address); // current contract
    return { web3, accounts, contract }; // returning the information in order to use in other component
  } else {
    window.alert("Smart contract not deployed to detected network."); // is displayed if there is no smart contract data
  }
}
```

> **NOTE**: [Web3](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.0/getting-started.html) is a javascript library that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain. It can retrieve user accounts, send transactions, interact with smart contracts, and more.

## After adding to our `InitWeb3.js` it can be closed. Now we need to do some work in the `App.js` in order to properly function and use our newly created functions. The first thing we need to do is delete everything in the file and start from scratch, scary I know but I promise we are not adding much. To start we are just going to import react with the `useState` and `useEffect` as well as our two functions from our `InitWeb3.js` and then declare the `App` react component.

```jsx -r-[App.js]/copy/
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { loadWeb3, loadBlockchainData } from "./components/InitWeb3";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

> **NOTE**: If you are unfamiliar with the [`useEffect`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) and [`useState`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) hooks it may be difficult to follow along so consider looking into them before continuing.

## Now we can utilize the `useEffect` hook in order to run the two functions when the page loads. After running our functions there are 3 things that we need from the `loadBlockchainData` function, the web3 instance, the accounts from ganache, and the current contract. We can receive those by using the `.then()` method and then isolate the 3 things we need.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  loadWeb3();
  loadBlockchainData().then((res) => {
    const web3 = res.web3;
    const accounts = res.accounts;
    const contract = res.contract;
  });
}, []);
```

## After isolating the values that we need we will utilize the `useState` hook in order to maintain them and use them in other places in our component. To do this we will have 3 states, 1 for each and then in the `useEffect` function we will set the values of each of the states to the corresponding value.

```jsx -r-{5-7,15-17}[App.js]/copy/
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { loadWeb3, loadBlockchainData } from "./components/InitWeb3";

const App = () => {
  const [web3, setWeb3] = useState(null);
  const [accounts, setAccount] = useState(null);
  const [contract, setContract] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    loadWeb3();
    loadBlockchainData().then((res) => {
      const web3 = res.web3;
      const accounts = res.accounts;
      const contract = res.contract;
      setWeb3(web3);
      setAccount(accounts);
      setContract(contract);
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Just like the boiler plate code we will have a `runExample` function to get things started. When called this function will do 2 things

1. Set a value (hard coded currently) in our smart contract from the current account.
2. Get the response that comes back from sending in that value.

## We will also need a new state variable in order to display the value of the response. As well as a section in our return that allows you to run the `runExample` function as well as see the response from the state. Also in the return, we need to monitor whether or not web3 has successfully loaded.

```jsx -r-{8,10-14,30-37}[App.js]/copy/
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { loadWeb3, loadBlockchainData } from "./components/InitWeb3";

const App = () => {
  const [web3, setWeb3] = useState(null);
  const [accounts, setAccount] = useState(null);
  const [contract, setContract] = useState(null);
  const [exampleResponse, setExampleResponse] = useState(null);

  const runExample = async () => {
    await contract.methods.set(5).send({ from: accounts[0] });
    const response = await contract.methods.get().call();
    setExampleResponse(response);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    loadWeb3();
    loadBlockchainData().then((res) => {
      const web3 = res.web3;
      const accounts = res.accounts;
      const contract = res.contract;
      setWeb3(web3);
      setAccount(accounts);
      setContract(contract);
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {!web3 ? (
        <div>Loading Web3, accounts, and contract...</div>
      ) : (
        <div>
          <button onClick={runExample}>Set Value</button>
          <h1>{exampleResponse}</h1>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Before firing up our project we need to first run `truffle compile` and then `truffle migrate` in order to first compile our solidity files and then "push" our solidity smart contracts to our simulated blockchain.

```bash
truffle compile
truffle migrate
npm start
```

## When you first open the page in your browser you will see 2 things, "Loading Web3, accounts, and contract..." and the metamask extension popup. In order to access the rest of our site we need to first login to metamask and then when logged in, add a custom RPC and import an account from our simulated blockchain running on ganache.

## In order to add a custom RPC click the "Ethereum Mainnet" dropdown then navigate to custom RPC. Once in custom RPC, enter whatever name you would like for the "Network Name" field, http://localhost:7545 for the "New RPC URL" field, 232 for the "Chain ID" field and ETH for the "Currency Symbol" field. After entering all of that information you can click save.

<img
  src={props.images[1].publicURL}
  style={{
    width: "50%",
    height: "50%",
  }}
/>

<img
  src={props.images[2].publicURL}
  style={{
    width: "50%",
    height: "50%",
  }}
/>

## After setting the custom RPC we need to import an account from our ganache blockchain. In order to do this click the profile icon in the top right and then navigate to import accounts. At this point we need to go back to ganache and click the key icon next to any account the copy its private key and then paste it in the import accounts field in metamask.

<img
  src={props.images[3].publicURL}
  style={{
    width: "30%",
    height: "30%",
  }}
/>

<img
  src={props.images[4].publicURL}
  style={{
    width: "70%",
    height: "70%",
  }}
/>

## After you have signed into that newly imported account you will see our set value button appear and if you click the button metamask will prompt you to proceed with the request, if you approve you will see the value 5 displayed.

> **NOTE**: Any displays of ethereum are completely simulated meaning that they are basically fake, do not be worried to confirm transactions you will not lose money in any way.

# Solidity Smart Contract

## At this point we need to work with Solidity. We are going to use Solidity to write a `mint` function that will allow the admin to mint nfts to their account.

# Solidity & Web3

## At this point we need to work with Solidity and Web3. We are going to use Solidity to write a `mint` function that will allow the user to create a new nft token and transfer it to their account. In order to actually access our function we need to use Web3 to preform the frontend interactions with the smart contract. If you have never worked with Solidity or Web3 it's okay because they are very easy to get started with and understand the basics of.

## You may have noticed by now that we a <F>contracts</F> folder outside of our client folder that contains two Solidity (.sol) files. The only file we are going to change in this folder is the `SimpleStorage.sol`, this is where our minting logic will happen.

## Right now the `SimpleStorage.sol` file has two functions, a <Peek>set()</Peek> function which sets the global variable `storedData` to the value passed into it and the <Peek>get()</Peek> which simply returns the value when called.

## In order to interact with these functions on our client side we use web3. When we were setting up the application we interacted with our `SimpleStorage.sol` with our `runExample()` function. Lets quickly revisit this function in order to understand just how this works because we previously skimmed over it.

```jsx {2,3}
const runExample = async () => {
  await contract.methods.set(5).send({ from: accounts[0] });
  const response = await contract.methods.get().call();
  setExampleResponse(response);
};
```

## The two highlighted lines are the web3 interactions with the smart contract. In the first highlighted line you can see that we access the contract methods with `contract.methods` and then access the <Peek>set()</Peek> function that we have in our Solidity smart contract and pass in the number of 5. This request is also coming from the current account that is accessing the page (to charge [gas fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) and such). The second highlighted line is calling our <Peek>get()</Peek> function inside of our contract that just returns that first value passed into the set function. Pretty simple right?

### Mint function - Solidity

## Now that we understand that lets get into the Solidity part of the mint function.

## The first thing we need to do is install the [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/) through npm. This is a library for secure smart contract development and has most of the ERC standards already in place to make our product production ready.

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

## At this point we can now open the `SimpleStorage.sol` file and start writing our function. The first thing we want to do is to delete all of the current contents of the file so that it is completely blank and rename it to `SimpleContract.sol`. Because we renamed our file we have to refactor some other files that may think its missing.

## In our <F>Migrations</F> folder our `2_deploy_contracts.js` should look like this. And our `InitWeb3.js` file should look like this.

```js -r-[2_deploy_contracts.js]/copy/
const SimpleContract = artifacts.require("./SimpleContract.sol");

module.exports = function (deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(SimpleContract);
};
```

```js -r-{2,21,23}[InitWeb3.js]/copy/
import Web3 from "web3";
import SimpleContract from "../contracts/SimpleContract.json";

export async function loadWeb3() {
  if (window.ethereum) {
    window.web3 = new Web3(window.ethereum);
    await window.ethereum.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" });
  } else if (window.web3) {
    window.web3 = new Web3(window.ethereum);
  } else {
    window.alert(
      "Non-Ethereum browser detected. You should consider trying MetaMask"
    );
  }
}
export async function loadBlockchainData() {
  const web3 = window.web3;
  const ethereum = window.ethereum;
  const accounts = await ethereum.request({ method: "eth_accounts" });
  const networkId = await web3.eth.net.getId();
  const networkData = SimpleContract.networks[networkId];
  if (networkData) {
    const abi = SimpleContract.abi;
    const address = networkData.address;
    const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, address);
    return { web3, accounts, contract };
  } else {
    window.alert("Smart contract not deployed to detected network.");
  }
}
```

## Now lets hop back into our `SimpleContract.sol`. We can quickly set up our contract by first declaring our version of Solidity, importing our OpenZeppelin contracts and declaring our contract name whilst utilizing the contracts imported.

```sol -r-[SimpleContract.sol]/copy/
pragma solidity 0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";

contract SimpleContract is ERC721 {
}
```

> **NOTE**: "SimpleContract" is the name of our contract and is what it will be referred as. You can change this name to your liking and the output will be the same.

### Mint function - Web3
